# In this Kernel, I'd like to show you a very basic segmentation technique whihc only applies pure computer vision techniques. Nothing fancy.
#
# At first, I'll show the step-by-step processing and after that I will create the submission for the competition.
#
# With this kernel, I could reach *0.229 LB* which is not very nice but I am sure that with a few tweaks we could get better score. And consider that **we don't even use the train data**! which is pretty awesome in my opinion.
